                The Bug Tracker is a Web-based software application designed to mirror any of a wide variety of bug tracking software 
                systems in use by corporations throughout world. If a company develops software, whether for in-house use or 
                distribution, it uses a bug tracking system to maintain an accurate record of the software development process on a 
                per-project basis.
